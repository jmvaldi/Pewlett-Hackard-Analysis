# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to bring into light the impeding "silver tsunami" that Pewlett Hackard will have to face in the coming time. There is a large number of employees that will soon retire, leaving job postions open. This is an issue that the company will need to address by an eligibility mentorship progam to foster high candiates in the compnay to step up and fill those vacancies. The work that was done to see this through was to create several database tables by pulling information from different company csv files. 

This is a diagram of the csv files that were used for the analysis:

## Results

The first task that was done was to create a table of the number of retiring employees by their title. The analysis highlighted that there are about 90,300 employees that are likely to retire in the foreseeable. About 57,600 of those employees are of senior level. 29414 of those are senior engineers. Senior positions are top priority to find potential candidates to takeover when the tsunami hits. The criteria for the retirement data was from employees born betwen 1952 and 1955.

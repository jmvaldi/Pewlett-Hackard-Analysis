# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to bring into light the impeding "silver tsunami" that Pewlett Hackard will have to face in the coming time. There is a large number of employees that will soon retire, leaving job postions open. This is an issue that the company will need to address by an eligibility mentorship progam to foster high candiates in the compnay to step up and fill those vacancies. The work that was done to see this through was to create several database tables by pulling information from different company csv files.
